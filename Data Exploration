Data Exploration
1. Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.

SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'naep';

2. Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.

SELECT *
FROM naep
LIMIT 50;

3. Trite a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.

SELECT state, COUNT(avg_math_4_score), MAX(avg_math_4_score), MIN(avg_math_4_score), ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 0)
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state;

4. Write a query that alters the previous query so that ir returns only the summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max and min values that are greater than 30.

SELECT  state, COUNT(avg_math_4_score), ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2), MAX(avg_math_4_score)-MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS diff_score
FROM naep
GROUP BY state
HAVING (MAX(avg_math_4_score)- MIN(avg_math_4_score)) >= 30;

5. Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states. This field should list the states in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2) AS bottom_10_states, state
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000
ORDER BY bottom_10_states ASC
LIMIT 10;

6. Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score, rounded to the nearest two decimal places, over all states in the year 2000.

SELECT state, ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2) AS math_score
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000
ORDER BY math_score;

7. Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000. This field should list all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over all states in the year 2000.

SELECT state AS below_average_states_y2000
FROM naep
WHERE avg_math_4_score < (SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2)
FROM naep
WHERE year = 2000)
AND year = 2000;

8.Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of the naep table for the year 2000.

SELECT state, avg_math_4_score AS scores_missing_y2000
FROM naep
WHERE avg_math_4_score IS NULL
AND year = 2000;

9. Write a query that returns, for the year 2000, the state, avg_math_4_score, and total_expenditure from the naep table, joined using the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause with the finance table. Use id as the key and order the output by total_expenditure from greatest to least. Make sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest two decimal places, and then filter out NULL values in avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.

SELECT naep.state, ROUND(avg_math_4_score,2), total_expenditure FROM naep 
LEFT OUTER JOIN finance 
ON naep.id = finance.id
WHERE avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL AND naep.year=2000 
ORDER BY total_expenditure DESC;
